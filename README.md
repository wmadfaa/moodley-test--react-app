Implement a small application that has 
a login form with email and password.
Accept a valid email and a random password. 
In case of an invalid entry or missing field, 
highlight the input field with a red border 
and animate an error modal in. 
Error Modal should have a title, description & closing button + a fancy animation of your choice.
After login, the user is redirected to a home view.
This view should implement a counter. 
A counter can be incremented and decremented by two icons, a plus and minus icon.
There is also another input field that allows to set the default value to a specific value,
otherwise start the counter by 0.
In addition, there are 2 buttons to reset the counter and logout of the application.

Bonus Task:Implement Redux to store the counter value in a redux store.
